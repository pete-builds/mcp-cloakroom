# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The latest commit on `main` is the only supported version. Older tags and releases are not patched.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security issue, **please do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Report it through [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](../../security/advisories/new), which is enabled on this repository. Include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (or a proof of concept)
- Affected versions, if known
- Your assessment of impact and severity

The report stays private to the maintainer until a fix ships. I will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and aim to ship a fix within 14 days for high-severity issues. Once the fix lands I will publish a GitHub Security Advisory crediting you (with your permission).

## Scope

In scope: code in this repository, the container image (if published), and any deployment configuration shipped here.

Out of scope: third-party dependencies (please report those upstream), social engineering, denial of service via volumetric attacks, and issues that require attacker-controlled physical access to the host.
